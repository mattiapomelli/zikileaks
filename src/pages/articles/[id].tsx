              Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with
              Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for
              typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling
              from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being
              really useful for building application UIs because you spend less
              time undoing user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em>{" "}
              just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text
              editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and
              unintuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
              We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly
              asking us things like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my{" "}
                <code>h1</code> elements? How do I disable this? What do you
                mean I lose all the other base styles too?
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our
              base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to
              remove annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code>{" "}
              element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really
              want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you
              want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not awful.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt to
              give you what you <em>actually</em> want, without any of the
              downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base
              styles.
            </p>
            <p>
              It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any
              block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful,
              well-formatted document:
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
